Purpose of this course
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This course, geog0111 Scientific Computing, is a term 1 MSc module worth
15 credits (25% of the term 1 credits) that aims to:

-  impart an understanding of scientific computing
-  give students a grounding in the basic principles of algorithm
   development and program construction
-  to introduce principles of computer-based image analysis and model
   development

It is open to students from a number of MSc courses run by the
Department of Geography UCL, but the material should be of wider value
to others wishing to make use of scientific computing.

The module will cover:

-  Computing in Python
-  Computing for image analysis
-  Computing for environmental modelling
-  Data visualisation for scientific applications

Learning Outcomes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the end of the module, students should:

-  have an understanding of the Python programmibng language and
   experience of its use
-  have an understanding of algorithm development and be able to use
   widely used scientific computing software to manipulate datasets and
   accomplish analytical tasks
-  have an understanding of the technical issues specific to image-based
   analysis, model implementation and scientific visualisation

Timetable
~~~~~~~~

The course takes place over 10 weeks in term 1, in the Geography
Department Unix Computing Lab (PB110) in the `Pearson Building`_, UCL.

Classes take place from the second week of term to the final week of
term, other than Reading week. See UCL `term dates`_ for further
information.

The timetable is available on the UCL Academic Calendar

Assessment
~~~~~~~~~

Assessment is through two pieces of coursework, submitted in both paper
form and electronically via Moodle.

See the `Moodle page`_ for more details.
