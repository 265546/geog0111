    "There is much public and scientific interest in monitoring and predicting the activity of wildfires and such topics are [often in the media](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15691060), or [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_(2018)) for a more recent event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of this interest stems from the role fire plays in issues such as land cover change, deforestation and forest degradation and [Carbon emissions](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/global-fire-emissions) from the land surface to the atmosphere, but also of concern are human health impacts, effects on [soil, erosion, etc](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282521100002X). The impacts of fire should not however be considered as wholy negative, as it plays a [significant role in natural ecosystem processes](http://www.pacificbio.org/initiatives/fire/fire_ecology.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "For many regions of the Earth, there are large inter-annual variations in the timing, frequency and severity of wildfires. Whilst anthropogenic activity accounts for a [large proportion](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/02/21/1617394114)  of fires started, this is not in itself [a new phenomenon](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3263421/), and fire has been and is used by humans to manage their environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fires spread where: (i) there is an ignition source (lightning or man, mostly); (ii) sufficient combustible fuel to maintain the fire. The latter is strongly dependent on fuel loads and mositure content, as well as meteorological conditions. Generally then, when conditions are drier (and there is sufficient fuel and appropriate weather conditions), we would expect fire spread to increase. If the number of ignitions remained approximately constant, this would mean more fires. [Many models of fire activity](http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/492949main_Figure-2-Wildfires.jpg) predict increases in fire frequency in the coming decades, although there may well be [different behaviours in different parts of the world](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6057/787.full).\n",

    "\n",
    "Satellite data has been able to provide us with increasingly useful tools for monitoring wildfire activity, particularly since 2000 with the MODIS instruments on the NASA Terra and Aqua (2002) satellites. A suite of [‘fire’ products](http://modis-fire.umd.edu/index.html) have been generated from these data that have been used in a large number of [publications](http://modis-fire.umd.edu/Publications.html) and [practical/management projects](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/near-real-time-data/firms).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is growing evidence of ‘teleconnection’ links between fire occurence and large scale climate patterns, such as [ENSO](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/enso/enso-tech.php).\n",

    "[![](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/ts.gif)](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed mechanisms are essentially that such climatic patterns are linked to local water status and temperature and thus affect the ability of fires to spread. For some regions of the Earth, empirical models built from such considerations have quite reasonable predictive skill, meaning that fire season severity might be predicted [some months ahead of time](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6057/787.full)."

    "\n",
    "In this session, you will be working in groups (of 3 or 4) to build a computer code in Python to explore links between fire activity and Sea Surface Temperature anomalies.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Using monthly fire count data from MODIS Terra, develop and test a predictive model for the number of fires per unit area per year driven by Sea Surface Temperature anomaly data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets should be created at 0.5 degree resolution on a latitude/longitude grid.\n",
